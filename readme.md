# example vscale api client

### motivation
- get insite how to write sdk for real projects
- use interfaces (for SOLID, mocking)
- use subServices structure I.e.  client.Droplet.List(), where List method can be defined for multiple services
- write something useful for yourself (vscale is cheapest option) for testing misc automations
- project structure is inspired by Digital Ocean go client
